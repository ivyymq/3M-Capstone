The code is for rename the column header:

```{r}
transformed.data = read.csv(file = 'data_pro.csv', header = T)# load file
names(transformed.data)=gsub("[.]","_",names(transformed.data)) # replace the "." in header to "_"
write.csv(transformed.data, "Data_Pro_header.csv", row.names=FALSE)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
